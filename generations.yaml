    description: "The first-generation Toyota Mirai represented Toyota's pioneering entry into hydrogen fuel cell vehicles available to the general public, though in limited markets with hydrogen refueling infrastructure. Featuring distinctive, polarizing styling with sharp character lines, prominent air intakes required for the fuel cell system cooling, and an overall futuristic aesthetic, the Mirai clearly announced its technological differentiation from conventional vehicles. Powered by a hydrogen fuel cell stack producing electricity that drives a 151 horsepower electric motor, the Mirai offered approximately 312 miles of range and could be refueled in about five minutes—advantages over battery electric vehicles of the era. The fuel cell system combined hydrogen stored in two carbon-fiber-reinforced tanks with oxygen from the air to produce electricity, emitting only water vapor as a byproduct. The interior featured a premium-focused design with an unusual split-level center console, multiple digital displays, and advanced technology including adaptive cruise control, lane departure alert, and pre-collision system—advanced features for 2014. Seating was limited to four passengers due to the center placement of the rear hydrogen tank. Initially available only in Japan, California, and select European markets with hydrogen infrastructure, the first-generation Mirai served as both a technology showcase and a practical zero-emission vehicle for early adopters, establishing Toyota's position in hydrogen fuel cell technology while providing valuable real-world data about the ownership experience. Despite limited production volumes and infrastructure challenges, the first-generation Mirai demonstrated Toyota's commitment to hydrogen as part of its electrification strategy, positioning the technology as complementary to battery electric vehicles rather than competing with them."

  - name: "Second Generation (JPD20)"

    end_year: null
    description: "The second-generation Toyota Mirai represents a dramatic reinvention of Toyota's hydrogen fuel cell vehicle, transitioning from the eco-car aesthetic of the first generation to a premium, luxury-focused sedan with striking proportions and elegant styling. Built on Toyota's rear-wheel drive TNGA-L platform shared with Lexus models, the new Mirai features a long hood, sweeping roofline, and a significantly more conventional yet sophisticated appearance compared to its predecessor. This fundamental platform change enables improved packaging with the hydrogen tanks now distributed more efficiently throughout the vehicle structure, allowing for five-passenger seating (up from four) and a more balanced weight distribution. The fuel cell stack is smaller yet more powerful, working with a larger battery buffer to power a rear-mounted electric motor producing 182 horsepower and 221 lb-ft of torque. Range increases substantially to approximately 402 miles in the base XLE trim (357 miles in the heavier Limited), representing a nearly 30% improvement over the first generation. The interior takes a significant step upmarket with a design and material quality approaching Lexus levels, featuring a 12.3-inch touchscreen infotainment system, digital instrument cluster, available semi-aniline leather upholstery, and a panoramic roof on higher trims. Technology is comprehensive with Toyota Safety Sense 2.5+ offering enhanced driver assistance features, a JBL sound system, and a digital rearview mirror among the available amenities. By repositioning the Mirai as a premium sedan with cutting-edge technology rather than simply an alternative-fuel vehicle, Toyota aims to broaden the appeal of hydrogen technology while continuing to advance fuel cell development. Though still limited to markets with hydrogen infrastructure (primarily California in the US), the second-generation Mirai makes a more compelling case for hydrogen as part of the zero-emission vehicle landscape, offering luxury, long range, and quick refueling as its key advantages over battery electric alternatives."
